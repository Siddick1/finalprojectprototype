#Reason behind the App:

During a discussion with one of my old friends who runs a hardware store, he told me that he is facing daily issues managing his store. Sometimes he thinks too much before coming up with the price of a product, he does not know the exact number of items that are remaining in the store for a particular category...

# The purpose of the App:
So the purpose of this application is to help him manage hardware store easily and can track his records as well.

# Functionality:

The application should be having the following functionalities:
View all available products and that will have sub-function which will allow him categorise different items;
He should be able to add a new category or product and he will also be able to take a picture of the product alongside its name, price, number of items available in the stock and so forth;
The user will be able to reduce the number of items of the product if it has been sold out.
The user will be able to sign in the app with his credentials to avoid unauthorized access.
